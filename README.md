# Overview #
AEM component to unlock an Active Directory account on a domain controller.

It allows you to allow less privileged techs to still perform a simple AD task, and sometimes it's just faster than logging into a server.

# Usage #
Run on your Active Directory server, the only variable is the account you want to unlock.

# Building #
Download or fork, run repackage.bat and upload aem-component.cpt to AEM. You can also download the aem-component.zip straight from this repository and install in your AEM instance.
